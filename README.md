# cppgraph

A **semantically accurate** code-graph tool for C++ (and any project with a
`compile_commands.json`). It builds a call/reference/inheritance graph from a
compiler-grade index — not from a syntactic AST — so symbol identity is exact
and edges are disambiguated (no name collisions, resolves overloads, virtual
dispatch, and pointer/reference method calls).

> **Why this exists.** Tree-sitter-based graph tools identify symbols *by name*.
> That both **over-captures** (merges distinct symbols that share a name into one
> node) and **under-captures** (drops calls it cannot bind syntactically:
> overloads, `ptr->method()`, free functions, templates, virtual dispatch).
> `cppgraph` uses a compiler front-end index (SCIP via `scip-clang`) where every
> symbol has a stable, unique identity (USR / mangled name), so the graph is the
> one the compiler actually sees.

## Status

Early, but functional end-to-end: build, query, incremental update, an MCP
server for LLMs, and visualization. The tool is general — point it at any C++
project's `compile_commands.json`.

## Pipeline

```
compile_commands.json  →  scip-clang  →  index.scip  →  cppgraph build  →  graph store
                          (semantic       (protobuf,      (parse + edges)    (query / MCP / viz)
                           indexer)         USR-keyed)
```

- **Builder** (`scip-clang`, external compiled binary): does the expensive,
  perf-critical C++ parsing. Crash-isolated per translation unit.
- **cppgraph** (this repo, Python): glue + graph. Parses SCIP, builds the graph,
  serves queries, exposes an MCP server, and can export a graph.json for
  visualization.

## Does it actually beat by-name tools?

Yes, measurably. On a real case (two distinct methods sharing the name
`makeResumeToken`), a tree-sitter tool drops the real call edges *and* collapses
431 unrelated `Value` sites onto one node; cppgraph returns the correct,
separated caller sets. Full write-up with numbers and reproduction steps:

large C++ codebase).

## Non-goals

- Re-implementing a C++ parser. We consume a compiler index.
- Being a linter or a refactoring engine. This is about *understanding structure*
  (who calls what, impact/blast-radius, inheritance) for humans and LLMs.

## Visualize

`cppgraph export '<symbol>' --graph <graph.db> --depth 2 --out graph.json` writes
a bounded neighbourhood in a [graphify](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify)-compatible
`graph.json`. Open it in the bundled viewer (`viz/cppgraph-viz.html`, our own
code + a vendored copy of vis-network, fully offline) — or, since the container
format is shared, in graphify itself. Details: [viz/README.md](viz/README.md).
